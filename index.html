                2. Free Education: The programs are offered at no cost to the students, making it accessible to individuals from economically challenged backgrounds.
                
                3. Curriculum: The curriculum focuses on software engineering and coding skills. It includes practical training and projects to ensure students gain hands-on experience.
                
                4. Job Placement: NavGurukul assists students in finding job placements after completing the course. The aim is to secure employment for graduates in the tech industry, helping them achieve financial independence.
